                    I have created this website keeping in mind the Wikipedia
                    page :
                    <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_characters"
                        >List of Harry Potter characters</a
                    >. The Wikipedia page does not have any visual, but is full
                    of valuable information. So, I created this website for all
                    the die-hearted <em>Harry Potter</em> fans so that whenever
                    they need to search for any Harry Potter character, they can
                    look upto this website and can dig in. Whenever reading
                    about a character, you can click on More about the Character
                    which will direct you to the "Fandom" page of the Harry
                    Potter Character and you will be able to know more about the
                    character.</span
                >

                <br />

                I have only tried to replicate the Wikipedia page mentioned
                above in a visually appealing way. I have made this website not
                to disrespect any of the websites mentioned above. I have only
                made this as a part of my own basic project (it is not a
                full-fledged working website, this is a static website) for fun
                and enjoyment, as I was getting bored and thought of creating
                something useful while learning Web Development.

                <br />
                <br />

                NOTE : When I was making this website, I was still a beginner
                and have only learned HTML, CSS and basics of JavaScript. So,
                pardon me for any mistakes that may remain.

                Hi, my name is Aman Dey. I am a Freshman, going to be a
                Sophomore, at Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College. I love
                doing projects and exploring new things, but the sad part is,
                now, I kinda only know HTML, CSS and basics of JavaScript. I
                think this is enough to know about me :-)
